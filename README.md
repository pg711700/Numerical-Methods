# Numerical-Methods
Numerical Methods to solve Mathematical Problems.

### 1. Method Of Bisection: 
     Using Binary search to find the solution of an algebraic or a transcendental equation.

### 2. Secant Method
     Iterative approach using secants to find the solution of an algebraic or transcendental equation.
       Note. This method is valid if the secant is never parallel to the X-axis.

### 3. RegulaFalsi Method
      This method is an optimisation to the Secant Method. The input of two x coordinates is supposed to be the 
      bounding region for the solution.
      It also uses the idea of Method of Bisection to ensure lesser cycles to reach the solution.
      This method is faster than the Secant Method!!
      
### 4. Newton Raphson Method
       The Newton-Raphson method is a powerful technique for solving equations 
       numerically. Like the differential calculus, it is based on the simple 
       idea of linear approximation. The Newton Method, properly used, usually 
       homes in on a root with devastating efficiency.
