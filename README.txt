Numerical Methods to solve Mathematical Problems.

1. Method Of Bisection: 
    Using Binary search to find the solution of an algebraic or a transcendental equation.

2. Secant Method
    Iterative approach using secants to find the solution of an algebraic or transcendental equation.
    Note. This method is valid if the secant is never parallel to the X-axis.

3. RegulaFalsi Method
     This method is an optimisation to the Secant Method. The input of two x coordinates is supposed to be the bounding region for the          solution. It also uses the idea of Method of Bisection to ensure lesser cycles to reach the solution.
     This method is faster than the Secant Method!!
