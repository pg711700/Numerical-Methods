# Numerical-Methods
Numerical Methods to solve Mathematical Problems.

1. Method Of Bisection: 
    Using Binary search to find the solution of an algebraic or a transcendental equation.

2. Secant Method
    Iterative approach using secants to find the solution of an algebraic or transcendental equation.
    Note. This method is valid if the secant is never parallel to the X-axis.
